# Human voicepack for Dreame robots
Adding a more natural and gentle voice to your Dreame robot

While other voice packs focus on quirky or humorous sounds, this one is designed to deliver a clear, refined, and authentic British English voice. Most sentences and sounds have been reworked and/or rewritten to provide a smoother and more polished listening experience.
